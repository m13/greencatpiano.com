        <p>Hello! Thank you for visiting our page.</p>

        <p>My name is Rumi and Iâ€™m a Music and Piano Teacher. I decided to start this series of videos and posts to
            share
            with everybody my love for music and share what I have learned through my teaching experience.</p>

        <p>I decided to combine all the things that I love: drawing, making music and teaching and that's how Green Cat
            Piano was born.</p>

        <p>My goal is to make everybody enjoy the beautiful and fun journey of learning music and give you these tools
            for
            the rest of your and your kids life.</p>

        <p>Is dedicated to parents and kids essentially but also to anyone who enjoys games and having fun with music
            there
            is no limit age for learning.</p>
